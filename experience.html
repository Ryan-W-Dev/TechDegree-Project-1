        <h2>ChildHood</h2>
        <p>I had a great childhood. Started racing dirtbikes when I was 4 years old. This is what started my passion for racing.</p>
        <p>My family and I then moved to the UAE (United Arab Emirates). I started racing motocross at Jebel Ali and this is where my career began.</p>
        <h2>University</h2>
            <p>I went to SEA in Dubai where I learnt computer graphics. Such as Photoshop, 3DS Max, and Adobe Illustrator.</p>
            <p>I later on moved to Croatia to Rochester Institute of Technology where I started my web and mobile course. I learntg a little of HTML, CSS and Java to name a few. Due to unforseen circumstances I moved back to Abu Dhabi and was unable to compkete my course there.</p>
